### Project 1 : **Raw Image Data Analysis and Processing Assignment**

1. **Data Processing**: demosaicking-bilinear interpolation, white balancing, color transforms, gamma encoding
2. **Denoising**
3. **HDR Imaging**



### Project 2 : **Creat 'Bokeh' Effect with All-in-focus Mobile Phone Video**

Overview : Synthesize images with smaller depths of field thus making it appear to have been taken from an expensive camera with large aperture.

1. Take an all-in focus video by moving the camera in zig-zag path, no tilt.
2. Use normalized cross correlation to extract pixel shift.
3. Synthesize a refocused ‘Bokeh’ by shifting each image in the opposite direction and sum up all frames.



### Project 3 : **NeRF Implementation**





### Project 4 : **Stable Diffusion**

explore a pre-trained stable diffusion model with parameter tuning. Try different VAE, text encoders, schedulers, etc.
